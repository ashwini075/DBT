Changing Values through Views.
1) Which of these views are updateable (will allow DML operations)?
#1
Create View Dailyorders
as
Select Distinct cnum, snum, onum, odate from Orders;
ans-yes
#2
Create View Custotals
as 
Select cname, Sum (amt) Sum_Amt from Orders, Customer
where Orders.cnum=Customer.cnum Group by cname;
ans->Views are note updatable which consists of join.


#3
Create view Thirdorders
as 
Select * from Dailyorders where odate=’1990-10-03’;

 ans->not updatable due to distinct keyword in dailyorders;
 
#4
Create view Nullcities
as Select snum, sname, city
from Salespeople where city is NULL
OR sname BETWEEN ‘A’ and ‘MZ’;
ans->yes

2) Create a view of the Salespeople table called Commissions. This view will include only the snum and comm fields. 
Through this view, someone could enter or change commissions, but only to values between .10 and .20.
-->
select * from salespeople;
create view snum_c
as
select snum,comm from salespeople where comm between .10 and .20 with check option;
select * from snum_c;
insert into snum_c values(2000,.5);     -- value not inserted into table
insert into snum_c values(2000,.15);     -- inserts value 

3) Some SQL implementations have a built-in constant representing the current date, sometimes called “CURDATE” or “SYSDATE”. 
The word SYSDATE can therefore be used in a SQL statement, and be replaced by the current date when the value is 
accessed by commands such as Select or Insert. We will use a view of the Orders table called Entryorders to insert rows into the Orders table.
 Create the Orders table, so that SYSDATE is automatically inserted for odate if no value is given. Then create the Entryorders view 
 so that no values can be given.
 
 -->
  create table ORDERSnew1
(
	Onum INT(4),
	Amt FLOAT(7,2),
	Odate datetime default current_timestamp,
	Cnum INT(4),
	Snum INT(4),
    constraint pk_onum primary key(onum)
);

select * from ordersnew1;

create view Entryorders 
as 
select * from ORDERSnew1;
 
insert into ordersnew1 values(101,3400,null,202,301);
 insert into ordersnew1 (onum,amt,cnum,snum)values(102,3400,202,301);
insert into ordersnew1 (onum,amt,cnum,snum)values(107,3400,202,301);
