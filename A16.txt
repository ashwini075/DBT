-- Assignment â€“ 16
-- Creating Tables and Indexes.
use assignment1;
desc orders;

-- 1) Write a command that will enable a user to pull orders grouped by date out of the Orders table quickly.
create index i_odate on orders(odate);
show index from orders;  -- for showing indexes

-- 2) If the Orders table has already been created, how can you force the onum field to be unique 
-- (assume all current values are unique)?
desc orders;
alter table orders add primary key(onum );

-- 3) Create an index that would permit each salesperson to retrieve his or her orders grouped by date quickly.
create index i_date on orders(onum,odate);

-- 4) Let us assume that each salesperson is to have only one customer of a given rating, and that this is currently the case. 
-- Enter a command that enforces it.

alter table customer modify primary key(Rating);
desc customer;
select * from customer;
